# Automatic-Colorization-Project
Automatic colorization of gray scale images using auto encoders

Conversion of a given gray-scale image to its corresponding colored image efficiently
as well as accurately with the help of various Machine Learning and Deep Learning
models such as : Keras, CV(Computer Vision), Numpy, etc along with Auto- Encoders. Created a model that will learn on its own with the help of various datasets available
and without any human intervention. With an aim to provide a direct function to convert
a gray-scale image to a colored image which can be embedded with various software
in the near future.
